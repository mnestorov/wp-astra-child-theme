# Astra Child

[![Licence](https://img.shields.io/github/license/Ileriayo/markdown-badges?style=for-the-badge)](./LICENSE)

## Overview

A WordPress child theme for [Astra theme](https://wordpress.org/themes/astra/) created by me for testing some ACF functionallity.

## Required plugins

- [ACF PRO](https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/pro/)
- [Classic Editor](https://wordpress.org/plugins/classic-editor/)

## How to install

- Inside your WordPress admin area, head over to ```Appearance Â» Themes``` page and click on the Add New button.
- Child theme came as a zip file, then you need to click on the ```Upload Theme``` button. This will show you theme upload option.
- Click on ```Choose File``` to select the theme zip file from your computer and then click on ```Install Now``` button.
- WordPress will now upload the theme zip file from your computer and install it. It will also check if the parent theme is installed. If parent theme is available from [WordPress.org](https://wordpress.org) theme directory, then it will try to install it. Otherwise, it will let you know that you will need to install parent theme manually.
- After installing both parent and child themes, you can go ahead and activate the child theme.
