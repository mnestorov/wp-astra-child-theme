# Astra Child

A WordPress child theme for [Astra theme](https://wordpress.org/themes/astra/) created by me for testing some ACF functionallity.

## Required plugins

- [ACF PRO](https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/pro/)
- [Classic Editor](https://wordpress.org/plugins/classic-editor/)

## How to install

1) Inside your WordPress admin area, head over to ```Appearance Â» Themes``` page and click on the Add New button.

2) Child theme came as a zip file, then you need to click on the ```Upload Theme``` button. This will show you theme upload option.

3) Click on ```Choose File``` to select the theme zip file from your computer and then click on ```Install Now``` button.

4) WordPress will now upload the theme zip file from your computer and install it. It will also check if the parent theme is installed. If parent theme is available from [WordPress.org](https://wordpress.org) theme directory, then it will try to install it. Otherwise, it will let you know that you will need to install parent theme manually.

5) After installing both parent and child themes, you can go ahead and activate the child theme.
